# Final_Group_Project - :brain:Brain Stroke Prediction
## Communication Protocal
We all have agreed that communication via SLACK or email is the best form of communication for our group.  We have created multiple Google Docs that we are collectively working on as well.
## Topic Selection
In selecting a topic, our team wanted to pick a dataset within the health industry.  We all have been affected by someone we know who has had a stroke, and we wanted to determine if we could understand what varying factors play a role in whether an individual is more or less likely to be at risk for having a stroke.
### Investigative Questions
1. What varying factors have the greatest impact on whether or not an individual is more at risk for having a stroke?
2. Can we predict whether or not a person is more at risk for having a stroke based on those varying factors?
## Data Source
Our dataset was soured from Kaggle - [Brain Stroke Data](https://github.com/AimeeJLewis/Final_Group_Project/blob/main/Brain_Stroke_Data/full_data.csv)<br>
<b>Columns:</b> Gender, Age, Hyptertension, Heart Disease Status, Marital Status, Work Type, Residence, Avg Glucose Level, BMI, Smoking Status, Stroke Status<br>
