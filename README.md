# Final_Group_Project - Brain Stroke Prediction
## Communication Protocal
We all have agreed that communication via SLACK or email is the best form of communication for our group.  We have created multiple Google Docs that we are collectively working on as well.
## Topic Selection
In selecting a topic, our team wanted to pick a dataset within the health industry.  We all have been affected by someone we know who has had a stroke, and we wanted to determine if we could understand what varying factors play a role in whether an individual is more or less likely to be at risk for having a stroke.
## Data Source
Our dataset was soured from Kaggle [Brain Stroke Data](../blob/main/Brain_Stroke_Data/full_data.csv)
