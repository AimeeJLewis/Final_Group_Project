# Final_Group_Project - Brain Stroke Prediction
## Topic Selection[^note]
In selecting a topic, our team wanted to pick a dataset within the health industry.  We all have been affected by someone we know who has had a stroke, and we wanted to determine if we could understand what varying factors play a role in whether an individual is more or less likely to be at risk for having a stroke.
